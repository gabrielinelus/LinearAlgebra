# LinearAlgebra

How to use:
   - To compile and run the unit test: 
       make lmfaola_test
       ./lmfaola_test
   - To use the library with any other project
       copy the include and src folders to your library
       include matrixutil.h, matrix.h, etc and since everything is templetised, they're ready to go.
       For running examples, check the unit tests.
