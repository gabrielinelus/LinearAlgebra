# LinearAlgebra

How to use:
   - To compile and run the unit test: 
       - make lmfaola_test
       - ./lmfaola_test
   - To use the library with any other project
       - copy the include and src folders to your library
       - include the libraries: matrixutil.h, matrix.h, etc. and since everything is templetised, they're ready to go.
   - For running examples, check the unit tests.
Note, this library depends on Eigen - install this first. (Check their website to see how to do that)
